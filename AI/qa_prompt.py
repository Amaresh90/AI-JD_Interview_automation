**Important Behaviors:**
- For each matched JD, generate Q&A relevant only to that JD's role.  
    > Example:  
    > Match 1: JD Title = "Python Developer"  
    >  Generate Q&A only about Python development.  
    > Match 2: JD Title = "Java Developer"  
    >  Generate Q&A only about Java development.  

- Generate **exactly {range_values}** questions for each JD.
- Questions should be of type: **{type_question}**.
- Follow the strict format instructions below.

---
**STRICT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS (READ CAREFULLY):**

- Each question MUST start with "Question " followed by its number, then a colon and the question text. 
Example: "Question 1: What is..."
- The answer MUST start on a ***NEW LINE (\n)*** after the question.
- The "Answer:" tag MUST be on a ***new line (\n)***.
- For each question-end add **"\n"** — answer for this question should come in **next line**.

---
**STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTION:**
1. Generate all the questions first.
2. For each question, place "Answer:" on a new line and write the answer immediately after.
3. Format properly.
4. Double-check compliance.
